# TypeSmash
TypeSmash is a typing game made with `Vue` and `ASP.NET Core`.  
It is still a work in progress.  
Anyone is free to contribute to this project.  
Source code of `Vue` is in [TypeSmash.Web/ClientApp](https://github.com/nosyminotaur/TypeSmash/tree/master/TypeSmash.Web/ClientApp).  
`AppSettings.json` is required to use an SQL Server database for Authentication. Ensure you have that present otherwise `dotnet` will throw an error.  
The `Vue`  app can be run locally as well by simply typing  
`npm install` to install dependencies  
`npm run serve`  
in [TypeSmash.Web/ClientApp](https://github.com/nosyminotaur/TypeSmash/tree/master/TypeSmash.Web/ClientApp).
